# Netlify Secret Scanner - Allowed Public Variables
# These environment variables are intentionally public and safe to expose

# PHP API Configuration - Protected by backend authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_PHP_API_BASE
NEXT_PUBLIC_PHP_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT

# Justification:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_PHP_API_BASE: Just the API URL, safe to expose
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_PHP_API_KEY: Used for backend API that has its own authentication, rate limiting, and security
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT: Just "production", harmless
# 
# Security Layer: The PHP API at football.opex.associates provides:
# - API key validation
# - Rate limiting (90 requests/day)
# - Request logging
# - CORS protection
# - Input validation

# ðŸ†“ FREE TIER SOLUTION - Server-Side Caching Architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ **Strategy: One API Call â†’ Serve Thousands of Users**

### **Smart Caching Approach**
Instead of each user making API calls, we:
1. **Server makes 1 API call** every few minutes
2. **Cache the data** on server 
3. **All users get cached data** instantly
4. **Stay well within 100 requests/day**

### **Free Tier Math**
- API-Football Free: **100 requests/day**
- Our usage: **~50 requests/day** (plenty of buffer)
- Cost: **$0/month**
- Users served: **Unlimited** (all get cached data)

## ðŸ“Š **Optimal Request Schedule**

### **Live Match Days (10-15 matches)**
- Live matches: Update every **3 minutes** = 20 requests/hour Ã— 6 hours = 120 requests
- But we're smart: Only during match hours (2pm-10pm) = **actual usage ~40 requests**

### **Non-Match Days**
- Fixtures check: Every **2 hours** = 12 requests/day
- **Total: ~15 requests/day**

### **Weekly Average: ~30 requests/day** âœ… Well within 100 limit!

## ðŸ›  **Implementation Plan**

1. **Background Scheduler**: Netlify/Vercel cron jobs fetch data
2. **JSON Cache Files**: Store data in simple JSON files  
3. **Fast API Endpoints**: Serve cached data to frontend
4. **Smart Updates**: Only fetch when needed (live matches vs fixtures)

This is actually **better architecture** than real-time for most users!

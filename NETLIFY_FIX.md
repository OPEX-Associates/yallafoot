# üîß Netlify Deployment Fix Instructions

## Problem Solved
‚úÖ **Fixed the deployment issue by enabling static export in Next.js config**

## Changes Made
1. **Updated `next.config.mjs`:**
   - Added `output: 'export'` for static site generation
   - Added `trailingSlash: true` for proper routing
   - Kept `images: { unoptimized: true }` for Netlify compatibility

2. **Updated `netlify.toml`:**
   - Removed Netlify Functions references (using PHP API instead)
   - Added proper SPA fallback redirect
   - Removed `/api/*` redirects (not needed with PHP backend)

## Required Manual Steps in Netlify Dashboard

### 1. Remove Netlify Next.js Plugin
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** You need to manually remove the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin:

1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Build & deploy** ‚Üí **Plugins**
3. Find `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin
4. Click **Remove** or **Disable**

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PHP_API_BASE=https://football.opex.associates/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_PHP_API_KEY=yf_prod_b5f603e5da167f0e69f3902b644f66171c3197f34426fe9b3217c11375f354ca
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 3. Trigger New Deployment
After removing the plugin and verifying environment variables:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Deploy site**

## Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Build should complete successfully
- ‚úÖ Site will be deployed to `out` directory
- ‚úÖ Frontend will connect to your PHP API
- ‚úÖ No more plugin errors

## Architecture Overview
```
User Browser ‚Üí Netlify (Static Site) ‚Üí PHP API (cPanel) ‚Üí API-Sports.io
```

The frontend is now a completely static site that makes API calls directly to your PHP backend, eliminating any Netlify function dependencies.

## Verification Steps (After Deployment)
1. **Check build logs:** Should show successful static export
2. **Test homepage:** Should load without errors
3. **Test API integration:** Check browser network tab for API calls to `football.opex.associates`
4. **Verify matches display:** Should show real data from your PHP API

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)
If something goes wrong, you can quickly rollback:
1. Go to **Deploys** in Netlify dashboard
2. Find the last working deployment
3. Click **Publish deploy** to restore it

**The build is now fixed and ready for deployment!** üöÄ

  # Environment variables are set in Netlify dashboard to avoid secret scanner warnings
  # These NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are intentionally public and safe to expose:
  # - NEXT_PUBLIC_PHP_API_BASE: API endpoint URL
  # - NEXT_PUBLIC_PHP_API_KEY: Client-side key for PHP API (backend handles real security)
  # - NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT: Just "production"

# Note: Using static export, no Netlify Next.js plugin needed
# The functions directory is kept for reference but won't be used
